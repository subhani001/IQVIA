Steps to run this code (Flask + SQLAlchemy + Celery)
This code is perfectly working with below instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Install Windows Python 3.6.5 and update system path folder with python path
- Go to folder where IQVIA code is available
- Install virtual environment through pip install virtualenv==16.7.3
- create virtual environment for Python
  > virtualenv venv
  > cd venv
- To activate virtual environment
  > Scripts\activate
- Install requirements through pip install command
   pip install Flask==1.1.1  Flask-JWT==0.3.2 Flask-RESTful==0.3.7 Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.4.0 redis==2.9.0 rq==1.1.0  SQLAlchemy==1.3.7  celery==3.1.24

- Install Redis( Redis-x64-3.2.100)
- Start Redis Server (Double click on redis-server.exe)
- Open one more command prompt and point to IQVIA folder.
  > set FLASK_APP=app.py
  > flask run
-Open one more command prompt  and point to IQVIA folder
 then type below command to start Celery
  > celery -A app.celeryapp worker -l info
-> Go to postman and import the JSON I have shared  i.e. IQVIA-Flask.postman_collection.json
--> Please set global variable in Postman as server_name is http://127.0.0.1:5000/
> Send Celery API request by clicking on Send button on GET /task endpoint
>Now watch command prompt where you were running celery. see log generating.
>Now go to postmant and click on GET /contacts endpoint to see updated results.
>I have also included Dockerfile to make the image of our flask application, so that it can be deployed
without any issues across environement. Just find the docker commands to create docker image
